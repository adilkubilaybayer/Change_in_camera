# Change_in_camera
Change in your camera in terms of digits

This code is very raw too.
So it's first of the first version EVER again... 
--------------------------------------------------------

-      CODE WILL BE UPDATED AND EXPLANATIONS WILL BE ADDED

-----------------------------------------------------------      

There are 2 files you can use each.
 
1-Acceleration_in_camera gives filtered results.
It will print the change of the change in camera, simply acceleration of camera(weird but i could not find another name)

2-Change_in_camera gives direct results
It is much more detailed than Acceleration_in_camera but prints pretty big numbers.

MOTION CAN BE MORE EASILY NOTICED WITH change_in_camera. Acceleration_in_camera is created due to an error and it can be thinked as an experimental code. 
However Acceleration_in_camera is not garbage

How it works?

It will print numbers, if there is a motion occurs

It print out how much your camera input is changed(how much motion exists) in terms of numbers. 

It will print out some number first but as you move or as some motion happens this number will increase.

Various things can be done with this output. I made an intruder alarm with it.

------------

NOTE: DO NOT AFRAID IF YOUR CAMERA GIVES OUTPUT DIFFERENT THAN 0 EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO CHANGE. THIS IS HAPPENING DUE TO THE CAMERA QUALITY, DUE TO THE CAMERA SOFTWARE AND DUE TO THE EDGES OF OBJECTS.
